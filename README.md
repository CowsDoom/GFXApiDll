# GFXApiDll \ Banana Splitter
GFX Api , used in Banana Splitter, is the first in-game splitter available! ( that I know ;) ) !!!!!!!!

# How to use ?

As of now, there's no custom dll injector, because I am a lazy bstrd, so you will have to inject  Banana Splitter with any injector 
out there that you like. -  I love Extreme Injector v3.3 by master131 , it's the one I use and ... holy molly, it's amazing! -
